GitHub made the way I work on a project very different. I am the kind of person that when assigned a project will sit down and do it immediately to avoid anxiety from having an unfinished task. But GitHub works by committing _major_ changes which isn’t usually how I do work. Luckily, in my negotiation class, we have weekly journal assignments which means I can’t complete the projects until I attend class. This kind of project is optimal for GitHub because I will have changes each week. To decide when to commit made sense to do so at the end of each week (in this case just the final week) because I would have a new entry written.
